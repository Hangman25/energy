        ## CIRRUS - Cloud-based Intelligent Resource for Renewable Utility and Solar Prediction
        
        **CIRRUS** is a solar energy prediction model that uses real-time METAR and forecased TAF-weather data from Charlotetown Airport
        to estimate the hourly solar power output for Slemon Park, Summerside, PE. It integrates weather station 
        data from Environment Canada and advanced machine learning model to provide 4-Hr solar power prediction.

        ### Key Features:
        - **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches METAR and TAF data to incorporate dynamic environmental conditions.
        - **Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses an optimized XGBoost model for accurate solar power forecasts.
        - **Cloud Coverage Integration**: Accounts for low, mid, and high-level clouds affecting solar radiation.
        - **Solar Position Calculations**: Computes solar elevation and azimuth angles for better prediction accuracy.

                - **METAR**: The first predicted solar energy value is based on the current METAR input, along with solar parameters such as *Solar Elevation*, *Solar Azimuth*, etc.  
                - **TAF**: The following three rows are predicted using the forecasted TAF and the corresponding solar parameters for each hour.  
                - **Handling Missing Values**: If any information is missing in the TAF, the previous values from METAR are used to fill in the gaps.  
                - **Assumptions**: Since the altimeter is only present in METAR (measured at the current time), it is assumed to remain constant for subsequent hours during the predictions.

                - **Validity**: Since a METAR report is based on current weather conditions, it is only valid for one hour.

TAFs complement and follow a similar encoding structure as *METAR* reports. They are produced by human forecasters stationed on the ground.
              - **Validity**: Since TAFs are weather forecasts, they remain valid for the *six hours* following their issuance.
              - **Location**: Similar to METAR, a TAF report is specific to a *predefined location*. In this case, the forecast is retrieved from the *Charlottetown, PE* airport.
